## Group A:

2. **What is Plasmid? Describe genetic recombination in 'Bacteria'.**

   **Plasmid:** A plasmid is a small, circular, double-stranded DNA molecule that is distinct from a cell's chromosomal DNA. Plasmids are naturally present in bacterial cells and can also be found in some eukaryotes. They often carry genes that provide advantageous traits, such as antibiotic resistance.

   **Genetic recombination in Bacteria:** Genetic recombination in bacteria can occur through several mechanisms, including:
   - **Transformation:** Uptake of naked DNA fragments from the environment and incorporation into the bacterial genome.
   - **Conjugation:** Direct transfer of DNA from one bacterial cell to another through a physical connection known as a pilus.
   - **Transduction:** Transfer of bacterial DNA from one bacterium to another via bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria).

3. **Define virion, viroid, and prion. Describe briefly classification of viruses and fine structure of TMV.**

   **Virion:** A virion is a complete virus particle that consists of an RNA or DNA core with a protein coat and, in some cases, external envelopes, and is the extracellular infectious form of a virus.

   **Viroid:** A viroid is a small, circular, single-stranded RNA molecule that lacks a protein coat and is capable of causing disease in plants by interfering with their gene expression.

   **Prion:** A prion is an infectious protein that causes neurodegenerative diseases by inducing abnormal folding of specific normal cellular proteins called prion proteins, which are found most abundantly in the brain.

   **Classification of Viruses:** Viruses are classified based on several criteria, including:
   - **Nucleic Acid Type:** DNA or RNA, single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds).
   - **Capsid Shape:** Helical, icosahedral, or complex.
   - **Presence of an Envelope:** Enveloped or non-enveloped.
   - **Mode of Replication:** Lytic or lysogenic cycles.

   **Fine Structure of TMV (Tobacco Mosaic Virus):** TMV is a rod-shaped virus with a helical capsid made of protein subunits. It has a single-stranded RNA genome that is approximately 6,400 nucleotides long. The protein subunits (capsomeres) are arranged in a spiral around the RNA, forming a rigid rod-like structure.

4. **What is Fermentation? Describe, in brief, industrial production of organic acids.**

   **Fermentation:** Fermentation is a metabolic process in which microorganisms convert sugars into energy and by-products, such as alcohol or organic acids, under anaerobic conditions.

   **Industrial Production of Organic Acids:** 
   - **Lactic Acid Production:** Produced by bacteria such as Lactobacillus in anaerobic conditions using sugars as substrates. It's widely used in the food industry and for producing biodegradable plastics.
   - **Citric Acid Production:** Produced by the fungus Aspergillus niger. It's used as a preservative, flavoring agent, and in pharmaceuticals.
   - **Acetic Acid Production:** Produced by Acetobacter species from ethanol. It's widely used in vinegar production and in the chemical industry.

5. **Write short notes on any two of the following:**
   - **(a) Mycoplasma:** Mycoplasmas are a group of bacteria that lack a cell wall, making them unique among prokaryotes. They are the smallest known cells capable of self-replication and are often associated with various diseases in humans, animals, and plants.
   
   - **(b) Biopesticides:** Biopesticides are biological or naturally derived agents used to control pests. They include microbial pesticides (e.g., bacteria, fungi), plant-incorporated protectants (genetically modified crops), and biochemical pesticides (natural substances). They are considered environmentally friendly and specific to target pests.

   - **(c) Gram's staining of bacteria:** Gram's staining is a differential staining technique used to classify bacteria into two groups: Gram-positive and Gram-negative. The procedure involves staining bacterial cells with crystal violet dye, followed by iodine, alcohol decolorization, and counterstaining with safranin. Gram-positive bacteria retain the crystal violet stain, appearing purple, while Gram-negative bacteria do not, appearing pink. This distinction is based on differences in cell wall structure, with Gram-positive bacteria having a thicker peptidoglycan layer.

 ## Group B:

6. **What do you mean by plant disease epidemiology? Describe, in brief, transmission and spread of plant pathogens.**

   **Plant Disease Epidemiology:** Plant disease epidemiology is the study of the factors affecting the outbreak, spread, and control of plant diseases. It focuses on understanding how diseases develop and spread within plant populations over time and space.

   **Transmission and Spread of Plant Pathogens:**
   - **Transmission:** Pathogens can be transmitted via various means:
     - **Airborne Transmission:** Fungal spores, bacteria, and viruses can be spread by wind, leading to widespread infection.
     - **Waterborne Transmission:** Pathogens can be spread through irrigation water, rain splashes, or runoff.
     - **Soilborne Transmission:** Pathogens present in the soil can infect plants through their roots or other underground parts.
     - **Vector Transmission:** Insects and other organisms can carry pathogens from one plant to another.
     - **Mechanical Transmission:** Human activities, such as the use of contaminated tools or handling of plants, can spread pathogens.

   **Spread:** The spread of plant pathogens is influenced by environmental factors, including temperature, humidity, and wind patterns, as well as the presence and behavior of vectors. Control measures involve monitoring, quarantining infected plants, using resistant plant varieties, and applying chemical or biological treatments.

7. **Give an account of genetics of resistance and susceptibility in plants.**

   **Genetics of Resistance and Susceptibility in Plants:**
   - **Resistance:** Genetic resistance in plants refers to the ability of a plant to prevent or mitigate the effects of a pathogen. This resistance can be either qualitative (major gene resistance) or quantitative (minor gene resistance). Major gene resistance often involves specific genes, known as resistance (R) genes, that recognize and respond to pathogen effectors. This recognition often triggers defense mechanisms such as the hypersensitive response, leading to localized cell death and preventing pathogen spread.

   - **Susceptibility:** Susceptibility occurs when a plant lacks effective defense mechanisms or R genes against a pathogen, allowing the pathogen to invade and cause disease. Susceptibility can also arise from the presence of susceptibility (S) genes that facilitate pathogen entry or growth.

   - **Breeding for Resistance:** Plant breeders work to develop resistant varieties by introducing R genes through traditional breeding or genetic engineering. Pyramiding multiple R genes can enhance resistance durability. However, pathogens can evolve and overcome these resistances, leading to an ongoing "arms race" between plants and pathogens.

8. **Describe symptoms, etiology, and control measures of red rot of sugarcane.**

   **Red Rot of Sugarcane:**
   - **Symptoms:** Red rot is characterized by the appearance of reddish streaks on the internal tissues of the cane. These streaks are often accompanied by a foul odor. Infected canes may show discoloration, wilting, and eventually die. The disease can also cause a reduction in sugar content and quality.

   - **Etiology:** Red rot is caused by the fungus *Colletotrichum falcatum*. The fungus infects the sugarcane through wounds or natural openings and spreads through the vascular tissues.

   - **Control Measures:**
     - **Cultural Practices:** Use of disease-free planting material, proper crop rotation, and removal of infected plant debris can help reduce the spread of the disease.
     - **Chemical Control:** Application of fungicides can provide protection, especially when applied at early stages of infection.
     - **Resistant Varieties:** Growing resistant sugarcane varieties is one of the most effective control measures.
     - **Biological Control:** Use of antagonistic organisms to control the spread of the pathogen.

9. **Write short notes on any two of the following:**
   - **(a) Hypersensitive Reaction:** The hypersensitive reaction is a defense mechanism in plants that occurs when plant cells rapidly die at the site of pathogen infection. This localized cell death helps to restrict the growth and spread of the pathogen, effectively "walling off" the infection. It's often associated with the presence of specific R genes that recognize pathogen avirulence (Avr) genes.

   - **(b) Cultural Practices of Plant Disease Management:** Cultural practices involve modifying agricultural practices to reduce disease incidence. These include crop rotation, intercropping, sanitation (removal of infected plant material), appropriate planting times, and spacing to reduce humidity around plants. These practices can help in breaking the life cycle of pathogens and reducing their spread.

   - **(c) Control of Smut of Barley:** Smut diseases in barley are caused by fungi like *Ustilago hordei*. Control measures include the use of disease-free seeds, resistant varieties, and chemical seed treatments. Additionally, crop rotation and proper field sanitation can help minimize the spread of the disease.

   - **(d) Systemic Fungicides:** Systemic fungicides are chemicals that are absorbed by plants and transported throughout their tissues. They can protect plants from fungal infections by inhibiting fungal growth or killing the fungi. Unlike contact fungicides, which remain on the plant surface, systemic fungicides provide internal protection and can sometimes eradicate established infections.
